# Hi, I'm Aditya 👋

Graduate student at [CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu), pursuing an MS in Computer Science. Summer '23 Intern at [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com). Formerly an engineer at [SentiSum](https://www.sentisum.com/), where I worked on the research and development of NLP and ML solutions. Also graduated from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in) in 2022, with a BTech (Honors) in Computer Science and MS (Research) in Computational Linguistics, where I have worked extensively on the application of deep-learning to research problems in low resource Indian languages and code-mixing.

Apart from my professional interests, I enjoy tinkering with small coding and hardware projects, and practice music making as a hobby.
