# Hi, I'm Aditya 👋

Incoming graduate student at CU Boulder, pursuing an MS in Computer Science. Also currently an Engineer at [SentiSum](https://www.sentisum.com/), where I work the research and development on NLP and ML solutions. Recent graduate of [IIIT Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in), with a BTech (Honors) in Computer Science and MS by research in Computational Linguistics, where I have worked extensively on the application of deep-learning to research problems in low resource Indian languages and code-mixing.

Apart from my professional interests, I enjoy tinkering with small coding and hardware projects, and practice music making as a hobby.
