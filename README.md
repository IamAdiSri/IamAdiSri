# Hi, I'm Aditya 👋

Currently wrapping up my BTech in Computer Science and MS by research in Computational Linguistics at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in). I have worked extensively on the application of deep-learning to research problems in low resource Indian languages and code-mixing.

Apart from my professional interests, I enjoy tinkering with small coding and hardware projects, and creative pursuits in music making.
