Also in the process of wrapping up my BTech in Computer Science and MS by research in Computational Linguistics at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in), where I have worked extensively on the application of deep-learning to research problems in low resource Indian languages and code-mixing.

Apart from my professional interests, I enjoy tinkering with small coding and hardware projects, and practice music making as a hobby.
